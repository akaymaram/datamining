# datamining

The project plan must include:
A short intro to the data mining task being studied and possibly the different variants of the task, complete with applications, and explanation of the computational challenges.
In this project, we are working at the intersection of text mining and graph based text encoding and possibility using some feature selection and machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis. We 

A high-level description of the algorithm(s) that you will implement, explaining the intuition behind it, i.e., how it tries to solve the computational challenges


A list of experiments that you will perform to evaluate the algorithm(s), complete with a list of datasets that you will use, and possibly a short description of different algorithms. Notice that it is usually appropriate to compare an algorithm to a baseline, i.e., an existing algorithm that tries to solve the same problem in a different way. Explain how you will compare your algorithm to the baseline.
We will evaluate the runtime of our text summarization algorithm. We will also evaluate how our output (the summary) changes as we change the input parameter of summary length. 
We plan on finding the optimal summary in three ways: 
Evaluating the length of the summary.
Research: Other text summarization algorithms.



A list of the work do be done, split down in relative simple steps

The list of what you will submit by the end of phase 3 and what you will submit by the end of phase 4, and how you will submit it.

Some logistics information, such as how you plan to share code and data among the members of the group, and how you plan to split the work (e.g., who is responsible for what and when).




The project plan will likely result in a 3-4 pages document.
